# Improved Learning Secrets Scoring Criteria

## Current Problem
The current criteria is too vague: **"How much unique/insider knowledge does this provide?"**

This leads to underscoring of valuable insights. Ali's meeting scored only 2-3/10 despite containing:
- Specific YouTube strategy advice from an expert
- Insider knowledge about rapid testing vs spending weeks/thousands on concepts  
- High-quality production insights for immediate channel success
- Strategic content planning methodologies

## Improved Learning Secrets Criteria (0-10 points)

**Score 8-10: Exceptional Insider Knowledge**
- Non-obvious strategies from proven experts in their field
- Specific tactical advice not commonly shared publicly
- Counterintuitive insights that challenge conventional wisdom
- Detailed processes/methodologies with specific steps
- Industry secrets or behind-the-scenes knowledge

**Score 6-7: Valuable Expert Knowledge**  
- Practical advice from experienced practitioners
- Specific examples of what works/doesn't work
- Strategic insights beyond basic best practices
- Actionable frameworks or systems
- Real-world case studies with specific details

**Score 4-5: Useful Learning**
- General best practices from knowledgeable sources
- Basic strategic advice that's somewhat specific
- Common knowledge but well-explained
- Standard industry advice with some specifics

**Score 2-3: Limited Learning Value**
- Vague or generic advice
- Commonly known information
- Basic observations without depth
- Theoretical concepts without practical application

**Score 0-1: No Significant Learning**
- Common sense advice
- Widely available information
- Superficial observations
- No actionable value

## Example Re-scoring of Ali's Insights

**1. "Create engaging YouTube content that subtly integrates the product"**
- Current score: 3/10
- **Should be: 7/10** - Specific advice from YouTube expert on product integration strategy, non-obvious approach of developing content series around product use cases

**2. "Utilize data-driven testing for YouTube content"** 
- Current score: 2/10
- **Should be: 8/10** - Insider knowledge about rapid testing vs expensive production, specific strategy to validate concepts before major investment

**3. "Focus on high-quality production and strategic planning"**
- Current score: 2/10  
- **Should be: 7/10** - Insider insight that "channels with high quality right off the start blow up right away", specific timeline advice (4-5 months planning)

**4. "Leverage short-form content for rapid audience engagement"**
- Current score: 2/10
- **Should be: 6/10** - Strategic advice for product launch support, specific tactic for audience building

## Recommended Prompt Update

Replace the vague criteria with specific examples:

```
- **Learning Secrets (0-10)**: How much unique/insider knowledge does this provide?
  * 8-10: Non-obvious strategies from experts, industry secrets, counterintuitive insights
  * 6-7: Practical expert advice, specific examples, actionable frameworks  
  * 4-5: Useful best practices with some specifics
  * 2-3: Generic advice, commonly known information
  * 0-1: Common sense, widely available information
```

This would result in much more accurate scoring that recognizes the true value of insider knowledge shared in meetings.
